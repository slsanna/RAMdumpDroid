## Overview
The RAMdumpDroid tool is designed to perform RAM memory acquisition of an emulated AVD device via the Android SDK suite. Key features include:
- Creation and configuration of custom AVDs;
- Management of created AVDs, with the possibility to delete them;
- Installation of applications via .apk files;
- Dumping of RAM memory, the main functionality of the tool.

The main objective of RAMdumpDroid is to support the forensic analysis of virtual devices by automating the RAM acquisition process. This procedure can be performed in two ways:
1. Full memory dump, using the LiME module.
2. Targeted acquisition of a single process, using the Frida tool.

pip3 install --target=~/Downloads/frida frida-tools
```
Download the correct version of frida-server for your device (frida-server-<frida's version>-android-<android's architecture of your mobile>) from
[Frida](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases), unzip the file and rename it as 'frida-server'.

### Fridump
Install Fridump with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nightbringer21/fridump.git ~/Downloads/
```

### Requirements

Install the requirements with

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
  
### Instructions

Follow the guide into repository
- Choose a proper kernel based on AVD'Android OS version
- Choose a proper compilator base on PC OS where you will compile the kernel
- Download and compile LiME module

After all of these procedures include in project repository, into /files, the compiled kernel (it has to be rename in 'ranchu-kernel') and the lime-goldfish.ko file of LiME after compilation.
It is important becuse the tool will search these files into this folder.
Add the desired .apk file into /apk_file 

## Use

Modify the file utils/config.py based on your configuration.
- It is possible choose API, ARCH of Android OS version
- Specify SDK folder path
- Specify AVD folder path
